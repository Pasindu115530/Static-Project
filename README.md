# ðŸŽ“ Statistical Analysis of University Student Monthly Expenses in Sri Lanka  

This project explores the **average monthly expenses** of Sri Lankan university students, based on survey data collected across multiple universities and faculties.  
The dataset captures demographic details (university, faculty, year, gender, living arrangement) and detailed expenditure categories such as **rent, utilities, food, transport, stationery, medical costs, and personal care**.  

Our analysis focuses on:  
- **Descriptive statistics** to summarize average spending per category.  
- **Estimation techniques** including confidence intervals to approximate the true average monthly expenditure.  
- **Group comparisons** to understand how expenses differ by living arrangement, gender, or university.  

All analysis and visualizations are carried out using **Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, SciPy)** to provide a clear picture of the financial challenges faced by students and to support future policy or university-level financial planning initiatives.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  

1. **Investigate relationships between expense categories**  
   - Explore whether higher spending in one area (e.g., rent) is associated with higher overall expenses.  

2. **Develop a regression model to predict total monthly expenditure**  
   - Use major categories such as rent, food, and transport as predictors to estimate total student expenses.  

3. **Provide actionable insights and recommendations**  
   - Help students, universities, and policymakers better understand and manage the financial challenges faced by undergraduates.
